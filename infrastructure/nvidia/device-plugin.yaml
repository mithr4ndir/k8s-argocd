# NVIDIA Device Plugin - Currently disabled
# The nvidia RuntimeClass allows GPU access without the device plugin
# The device plugin would enable nvidia.com/gpu resource requests
# but requires additional container toolkit configuration
#
# To re-enable, see: https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin
